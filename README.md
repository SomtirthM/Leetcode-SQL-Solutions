Hey fellow Data Enthusiasts. SQL is bread and butter for almost every one of us Data enthusiasts. So, learning SQL is an essential part of approaching any Data related fields. 
The best way to learn anything is to get your hands dirty by practicing, practicing and more practicing. SQL is no different than this, and what better platform than Leetcode to test your skills.
First, please give yourself enough backing and try the problems in Leetcode on your own. If not, I am here to help you with the solutions that I have figured out while practicing Leetcode.

Cheers! Happy Learning!! :)
